Notes on T-Symmetry 

The macroscopic universe is seen as time asymmetrical. The observable universe moves from low entropy to high entropy, creating a measurment of time that always moves forward. 
One of the possibilities is that we chose this measurement ONLY because that's how we understand our universe's creation. Big bang. 
Theoretical science on this proposes experiments that attempt to disprove this theory, and to align Time with other physical properties, which are reversable. (Idea: there is an irony to this kind of thinking. The higher entropy idea (that Time is different than gravity, say, and therefore doesn't fit into a nice package with the rest of our understandings) is moving towards the lower entropy idea (T-Symmetry) through sheer human will. This structuralist perspective is on full display here, men trying to make everything fit. In my book I will do the same, but for different reasons, for time reversal, and the hope of more time. 
Maxwell's Demon: a little tiny guy atop a massless door connecting two rooms of particles. He/she/they open the door a specific way letting fast particles pass through from one side, and letting slow particles through from the other. This creates a hot (fast) room and a cold (slow) room, thereby creating two lower entropy systems and violating the second law of thermodynamics. 
Heat death of the universe. Yes. 
The opposite of a black hole is a white hole. It cannot be entered from the outside, but energy and light can escape from within it. Ruin vs. Utopia. 
[Idea for the Longo review--T-Empathy. The book attempts to posit the theory of T Empathy, a kind of emo relativity. My review has to hammer home the idea of Longo's time. Destroyer series, Durer's Melencolia I, career, Covid, BLM protests, etc. Alchemical need for an object to act as a conduit, in his case the polyhedron, in mine this book.
